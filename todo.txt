Come up with minimal examples to demonstrate the following via openssl:

* PKE and signatures (RSA should be fine)

  https://gist.github.com/c9n/3751453d5dc1466829c3
* DHKX
* AES (CBC or CTR)

How to choose name for correspondent?  Could get it from local contact file,
or it could be sent as part of the handshake / hello message, or it could just
be set from local command line, but it seems that the correspondent should be
able to choose.
